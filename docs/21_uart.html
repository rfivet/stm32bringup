<h1>2.1 UART Validation</h1>

Before I start writing some code that communicates over the Universal
Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (<b>USART</b>) peripheral, I need
to validate that I have working hardware and software tools.

<h2>Board Connectivity</h2>

Even if the peripheral is capable of doing synchronous communication
(that’s the S in USART), asynchronous communication (that’s the A) which
only needs 3 wires (GND, TX, RX, (no clock)) is usually what is needed
in non specialized cases.
<p>
Boards sold online often have dedicated pre-soldered pins for UART
connectivity similar to what I have seen before for the SWD interface.
The VCC-GND board I used previously doesn’t have such dedicated pins but the
functionality is wired on the pins PA9 (<b>TX</b>) and PA10 (<b>RX</b>).
<p>
I will use a board with dedicated pins (GND, TX, RX, VCC 3.3V). Board
specifications can be found
<a href="https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F030F4P6-STM32F030F4-V2.00">
here</a>.

<h2>USB to UART adapter</h2>

An adapter is needed to connect to a PC. Either due to difference in
voltage (<b>RS232</b>) or serial protocol (<b>USB</b>). Pins PA9 and PA10 are
5V tolerant, so you could interface an Arduino Uno to a STM32 board to use
it as a USB to serial adapter if you happen to have a spare Arduino Uno.
<p>
I use an adapter based on <b>Silicon Labs CP2102</b> chipset.
Windows has USB driver available for Silicon Labs CP210x chipset family.
The adapter enumerates as <b>COM4</b> on my Windows PC.
<p>
I connect the adapter to the board to provide 3.3V and make sure to cross
RX and TX wires (STM32 RX <-> Adapter TX, STM32 TX <-> Adapter RX).

<h2>STM32 Cube Programmer UART connection</h2>

So far I have been using the ST-Link interface with STM32 Cube
Programmer to flash and debug. The application also support the UART
interface.

<h2>Embedded Boot Loader</h2>

A reset of the board while jumper <b>BOOT0</b> is removed will select the
System memory instead of the flash memory for execution. This is where
the serial flash loader protocol is implemented on chipset side.
<p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

The checklist goes like this:
<ul>
<li> Board connected to USB adapter

<li> USB driver installed on Windows PC

<li> USB adapter plugged in and enumerates as a COM port

<li> STM32 Cube Programmer list the COM port in device selection menu

<li> BOOT0 jumper removed and board reset to start the embedded flash
loader.

<li> Board flash memory can be erased, written or read with the programmer.
</ul>
<h2>Checkpoint</h2>

I have now working hardware and software that communicate through the
serial link.
<p>
<a href="22_board.html">Next</a>, I will make sure the code I wrote so far is
working on the new board.
