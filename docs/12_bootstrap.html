<h1>1.2 Bootstrap</h1>

<h2>Revising the link script</h2>
To validate the toolchain, I picked up <b>mem.ld</b>, the simplest sample link
script, and used it as it is.

<pre>
/* Linker script to configure memory regions.
 * Need modifying for a specific board.
 *   FLASH.ORIGIN: starting address of flash
 *   FLASH.LENGTH: length of flash
 *   RAM.ORIGIN: starting address of RAM bank 0
 *   RAM.LENGTH: length of RAM bank 0
 */
MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x0, LENGTH = 0x20000 /* 128K */
  RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 0x2000 /* 8K */
}
</pre>

It needs to be modified with actual flash and ram locations and sizes.
<p>
Also this link script does not contain any information for the linker to know
how to locate the output of the C compiler. Code, constant data and initial
value of variables need to be located in flash, variables and stack need to be
located in ram. I need a better link script that specify all of that.
<b>nokeep.ld</b> in the sample scripts folder is the one I need.

<pre>
/* Linker script to configure memory regions.
 * Need modifying for a specific board.
 *   FLASH.ORIGIN: starting address of flash
 *   FLASH.LENGTH: length of flash
 *   RAM.ORIGIN: starting address of RAM bank 0
 *   RAM.LENGTH: length of RAM bank 0
 */
MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x0, LENGTH = 0x20000 /* 128K */
  RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 0x2000 /* 8K */
}

/* Linker script to place sections and symbol values. Should be used together
 * with other linker script that defines memory regions FLASH and RAM.
 * It references following symbols, which must be defined in code:
 *   Reset_Handler : Entry of reset handler
 *
 * It defines following symbols, which code can use without definition:
 *   __exidx_start
 *   __exidx_end
...
...
 *   __StackTop
 *   __stack
 */
ENTRY(Reset_Handler)

SECTIONS
{
...
...
</pre>

From this snippet I can see that not only flash and ram parameters but also
the entry point for code execution, <b>Reset_Handler</b>, needs to be provided.
<p>
As a check, let’s change the link script to <b>nokeep.ld</b> in <b>Makefile</b>
and generate an executable <b>.elf</b> from the empty source code file
<b>empty.c</b>:

<pre>
LD_SCRIPT = $(GCCDIR)/share/gcc-arm-none-eabi/samples/ldscripts/nokeep.ld
</pre>

<pre>
$ make empty.elf
empty.elf
D:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-mi
ngw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi\bin\arm-none-eabi-ld.exe: warning: cannot find entry 
symbol Reset_Handler; defaulting to 00000000
rm empty.o
</pre>

The linker gives a warning and fallback on a default address as entry point.
<p>
So let’s create <b>boot.c</b> with an idle loop as <b>Reset_Handler</b>:
<pre>
void Reset_Handler( void) {
    for( ;;) ;
}
</pre>

In order to better understand the output of the link phase, I make the
following changes to the <b>Makefile</b>:
<ul>
<li> Add debug information by passing the <b>-g</b> flag to the C compiler.
<li> Call the linker with the flags <b>-Map=$*.map -cref</b> to produce a link
map that also includes a cross reference table.
<li> List the size of the sections by using the <b>size</b> command.
<li> call <b>objdump -hS</b> to generate a disassembly listing that includes a
list of the sections and makes use of the debug info to mix C source with
assembly code.
<li> Insure that the <b>clean</b> rule removes the newly generated <b>.map</b> and
<b>.lst</b> files.
</ul>

<pre>
OBJDUMP = $(BINPFX)objdump
SIZE    = $(BINPFX)size

CFLAGS = -g

clean:
    @echo CLEAN
    @rm -f *.o *.elf *.map *.lst *.bin *.hex

%.elf: %.o
    @echo $@
    $(LD) -T$(LD_SCRIPT) -Map=$*.map -cref -o $@ $<
    $(SIZE) $@
    $(OBJDUMP) -hS $@ > $*.lst
</pre>

<pre>
$ make boot.elf
boot.elf
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     12       0       0      12       c boot.elf
rm boot.o
</pre>

I can see that this build results in 12 bytes of code in the text section.
More details can be found in the <b>boot.map</b> and <b>boot.lst</b> files.

<h2>Targeting the STM32F030F4P6</h2>
To be able to build a boot code that could bootstrap a board equipped with a
STM32F030F4P6, I need to know the following about this micro-controller:
<ul>
<li> <b>Core</b>: Arm 32 bit <b>Cortex-M0</b> CPU.
<li> 16KB <b>Flash</b> located at 0x08000000.
<li> 4KB <b>Ram</b> located at 0x20000000.
</ul>
I make a copy of the sample <b>nokeep.ld</b> link script in my working folder
under the name <b>f030f4.ld</b> and change the <b>MEMORY</b> region accordingly.

<pre>
MEMORY
{
    FLASH (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 16K
    RAM   (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH =  4K
}
</pre>

The <b>Makefile</b> needs the following changes:
<ul>
<li> Specify <b>f030f4.ld</b> as the link script
<li> C compiler flags to generate thumb Cortex-M0 code.
<li> Request the C compiler to generate extra warning and optimize for size.
</ul>
<pre>
CPU = -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m0
CFLAGS = $(CPU) -g -Wall -Wextra -Os
LD_SCRIPT = f030f4.ld
</pre>

At boot time, the Arm core fetches the initial address of the stack pointer
and the address where to start execution from the first two entries of its
interrupt routine table. I have to modify <b>boot.c</b> to initialize such a
table in accord with the symbols defined in the link script.

<pre>
/* Memory locations defined by linker script */
extern long __StackTop ;        /* &__StackTop points after end of stack */
void Reset_Handler( void) ;     /* Entry point for execution */

/* Interrupt vector table:
 * 1  Stack Pointer reset value
 * 15 System Exceptions
 * NN Device specific Interrupts
 */
typedef void (*isr_p)( void) ;
isr_p const isr_vector[ 2] __attribute__((section(".isr_vector"))) = {
    (isr_p) &__StackTop,
/* System Exceptions */
    Reset_Handler
} ;

void Reset_Handler( void) {
    for( ;;) ;
}
</pre>

<b>__StackTop</b> is defined by the linker script and is located after the end
of the RAM. I use the GNU C extension <b>__attribute__()</b> to name the section
where I want the interrupt vector to be included. If you check the linker
script you will see that it places <b>.isr_vector</b> at the start of the
<b>text</b> area which is located at the beginning of the flash memory. I chose
to name the interrupt vector table <b>isr_vector</b> to match the section name
<b>.isr_vector</b>, but it is really the section name that matters here.

<pre>
$ make boot.hex
boot.elf
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     10       0       0      10       a boot.elf
boot.hex
rm boot.elf boot.o
</pre>

A build produces 10 bytes of code, I can check the disassembly in the
<b>boot.lst</b> file.

<pre>
Disassembly of section .text:

08000000 &lt;isr_vector>:
 8000000:   00 10 00 20 09 00 00 08                             ... ....

08000008 &lt;Reset_Handler>:
/* System Exceptions */
    Reset_Handler
} ;

void Reset_Handler( void) {
    for( ;;) ;
 8000008:   e7fe        b.n 8000008 &lt;Reset_Handler>
</pre>
<ul>
<li> The interrupt vector table is at address <b>0x08000000</b>, the beginning
of the flash.
<li> Its first entry, the initial stack pointer value, is the address
<b>0x20001000</b>, which is the first location after the end of the 4K RAM.
<li> Its next entry is <b>0x08000009</b>. I expect <b>0x08000008</b> here, as
this is the first location after the small interrupt vector table I created.
The lowest bit is set to 1 to mark that it is indeed the address of an interrupt
routine. So the value is correct even if an odd address value is not possible
for an opcode location.
<li> Finally, I found the code for our idle loop at <b>0x08000008</b> as
expected.
</ul>

<h2>Checkpoint</h2>
I have built a first executable targeting a member of the STM32 family.
<p>
<a href="13_flash.html">Next</a>, I will take a board with a STM32F030F4P6 and
check if the code generated behaves as expected.

Below is the <b>Makefile</b> for reference. If you happen to cut&paste from this
