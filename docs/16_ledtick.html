<h1>1.6 The Tick</h1>

<img alt="It’s blue! It blinks! It’s the Tick!" src="img/16_tick.png">
<p>
In previous iteration, I made the user LED blink using an active delay
loop. I have two issues with this implementation:
<ul>
<li> It’s hard to control the delay timing accurately
</ul><ul>
<li> Active loops are not cool
</ul>
So I am going to call in some serious reinforcement, which means one of
the Arm Core Peripherals: the System Tick.
<p>
What the System Tick does is very similar to my active delay loop as
can be seen from the following pseudo-code.

<pre>
while( enabled) {
    if( --current_value == 0) {
        current_value = reload_value ;
        countflag = true ;
        if( interrupt_enabled)
            SysTick_Handler() ;
    }
}
</pre>

It’s an auto decremented counter that reloads and sets a flag when
reaching zero. It can trigger a system interrupt if requested to. Its
default clock is the processor clock and can be switched to external
clock. Details can be found in the Programming Manual as this is part of
Arm Core.

<h2>Code, build and test</h2>

I copy <b>blink.c</b> into <b>ledtick.c</b> to make the following
modifications:
<ul>
<li> Expand the interrupt vector to make room for all 15 System Exceptions
from <b>Reset_Handler</b> to <b>SysTick_Handler</b>.
</ul><ul>
<li> Introduce the <b>SysTick</b> core peripheral to the compiler, using
pre-processor macroes to give the location of SysTick registers. As this
is a core peripheral, it’s in a different address space than the
peripherals I have seen so far.
</ul><ul>
<li> Start the <b>Reset_Handler</b> by initializing and enabling the System
Tick. The reload value register is initialized with a constant based on
the internal clock value divided by 8. As I want one tick per second and
the default internal clock is 8 MHz, SysTick will have to count one
million steps, from 999999 to 0. So the reload value is 999999.
</ul><ul>
<li> Create the <b>SysTick_Handler</b> interrupt routine which toggles GPIO
B1.
</ul><ul>
<li> Replace the previous active delay loop by a <b>cool</b> idle loop.
Instead of doing nothing actively, I instruct the processor to wait for
interrupt, which means it will suspend until waked up by the SysTick.
This is one way to lower power consumption, besides, waiting for SysTick
interrupt is really the only thing left to do.
</ul>

    for( ;;)

}

void SysTick_Handler( void) {
    GPIOB_ODR ^= 1 << 1 ;   /* Toggle PB1 (User LED) */
}
</pre>

I didn’t initialize the GPIO B before enabling the SysTick as I have a
whole second before the first interrupt will tick in.
<p>
Build is straightforward.

<pre>
$ make ledtick.hex
ledtick.elf
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    148       0       0     148      94 ledtick.elf
ledtick.hex
rm ledtick.o ledtick.elf
</pre>

If I compare with blink.hex, 56 bytes of the 80 bytes code increase are
due to the expansion of the interrupt vector.
<p>
Once flashed in the board I can see that the LED changes state every second.

<h2>Checkpoint</h2>

I now have the foundation for timing and a first taste of shifting
execution between the main loop and an interrupt routine.
<p>
Code size has been growing steadily since the first bootstrap. On the
other hand, except for the stack, I have not used RAM memory so far.
