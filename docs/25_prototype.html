<h1>2.5 uptime prototype</h1>

With the basic functionality available so far, I can write something in
the vein of the Unix <code>uptime</code> command.

<pre>
$ man -k uptime
uptime (1)           - Tell how long the system has been running.
</pre>

I am going to make a quick prototype first to validate the concept.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

I already have a one second based System Tick interrupt routine, so I
just need to make sure it updates a count of seconds. I make a copy of
<b>usart1tx.c</b> as <b>uplow.1.c</b> to make the changes. I use a number
suffix for the filename when I anticipate making several revisions.

<pre>
volatile unsigned uptime ;  /* seconds elapsed since boot */

#ifdef LED_ON
static void userLEDtoggle( void) {
    GPIO( LED_IOP)[ ODR] ^= 1 << LED_PIN ;   /* Toggle User LED */
}
#endif

void SysTick_Handler( void) {
    uptime += 1 ;
#ifdef LED_ON
    userLEDtoggle() ;
#endif
}
</pre>

The global variable <code>uptime</code> is marked <code>volatile</code>, the
compiler needs this information to avoid optimization as the value changes
concurrently when an interrupt is triggered.
<p>
I move the user LED toggling code to a dedicated local function
<code>userLEDtoggle()</code> as this is not the only task of
<code>SysTick_Handler()</code> anymore and a call to toggle the LED is needed
during initialization. I adjust the initialization code accordingly.
<p>
I write a first <b>uptime.1.c</b> to print the count of seconds every time
the <code>uptime</code> counter value changes.

<pre>
/* uptime.1.c -- tells how long the system has been running */
#include &lt;stdio.h>

extern volatile unsigned uptime ;
extern void kputc( unsigned char c) ;

void kputu( unsigned u) {
    unsigned r = u % 10 ;
    u /= 10 ;
    if( u)
        kputu( u) ;

    kputc( '0' + r) ;
}

int main( void) {
    static unsigned last ;

    for( ;;)
        if( last != uptime) {
            last = uptime ;
            kputu( last) ;
            puts( " sec") ;
        } else
            __asm( "WFI") ; /* Wait for System Tick Interrupt */
}
</pre>

As before for <code>kputc()</code>, the implementation of <code>kputu()</code>
to print an unsigned integer in decimal format is not optimal but still
functional.

<h2>Build</h2>

I update <b>Makefile</b> with the composition.

<pre>SRCS = startup.c uplow.1.c uptime.1.c</pre>

Unfortunately, when I try to build an executable, the link phase fails.

<pre>
$ make
f030f4.elf
D:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-mi
ngw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi\bin\arm-none-eabi-ld.exe: uptime.1.o: in function `kp
utu':
D:\home\Projects\stm32bringup/uptime.1.c:13:(.text+0x6): undefined reference to 
`__aeabi_uidivmod'
D:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-mi
ngw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi\bin\arm-none-eabi-ld.exe: D:\home\Projects\stm32bring
up/uptime.1.c:14:(.text+0x14): undefined reference to `__aeabi_uidiv'
make: *** [Makefile:49: f030f4.elf] Error 1
</pre>

The compiler has generated code that references two functions
<code>__aeabi_uidivmod</code> and <code>__aeabi_uidiv</code> when compiling
the lines 13 and 14 of <b>uptime.1.c</b>.

<pre>
    unsigned r = u % 10 ;
    u /= 10 ;
</pre>

This happens because the compiler generates code for Cortex-M0 which has
no integer division support. So integer division needs to be implemented
by code as it is not supported by hardware.

I need to pass the linker a reference to GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
library for Cortex-M0. The library file is <b>libgcc.a</b>, the option -l and
-L of the linker tell what the library name is (-lgcc => libgcc.a) and
where to look for it.

<pre>
LIBDIR  = $(GCCDIR)/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/14.2.1/thumb/v6-m/nofp
LIB_PATHS = -L$(LIBDIR)
LIBS = -lgcc

$(PROJECT).elf: $(OBJS)
    @echo $@
    $(LD) -T$(LD_SCRIPT) $(LIB_PATHS) -Map=$(PROJECT).map -cref -o $@ $^ $(LIBS)
    $(SIZE) $@
    $(OBJDUMP) -hS $@ > $(PROJECT).lst
</pre>

Once the Makefile has been updated, the build finish successfully.

<pre>
$ make
f030f4.elf
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    769       0       8     777     309 f030f4.elf
f030f4.hex
f030f4.bin
</pre>

Checking the linker produced map file, <b>f030f4.map</b>, I can see which
library (<b>libgcc.a</b>) but also which modules in the library (
<b>_udivsi3.o</b> and <b>_dvmd_tls.o</b>) have been used to resolve the
symbols (<code>__aeabi_uidiv</code> and <code>__aeabi_idiv0</code>).

</pre>

<h2>Testing</h2>

I flash the board and start execution, the output works as expected, the
first line “<b>1 sec</b>” appears one second after reset with a new line
following every second after that.

<h2>Library management</h2>

With Cortex-M0 version of <b>libgcc.a</b> available I have some extra
flexibility in handling usage of the library.
<ol>
<li> Work with a local copy of the <b>gcc</b> library.
<ul>
<li> copy libgcc.a locally
<li> LIB_PATHS = -L.
<li> LIBS = -lgcc
</ul>
<li> Work with a local copy of the modules extracted from the <b>gcc</b>
library.
<ul>
<li> ar x libgcc.a _udivsi3.o _dvmd_tls.o
<li> LIB_PATHS = -L.
<li> LIBS = _udivsi3.o _dvmd_tls.o
</ul>
<li> Work with my own library made from the needed modules extracted from
the <b>gcc</b> library.
<ul>
<li> ar x libgcc.a _udivsi3.o _dvmd_tls.o
<li> ar qc libstm32.a _udivsi3.o _dvmd_tls.o
<li> LIB_PATHS = -L.
<li> LIBS = -lstm32
</ul>
</ol>
The <b><i>ar</i></b> command distributed by the GNU Arm embedded toolchain is
the same <b>GNU <i>ar</i></b> as found in the Linux distributions or Cygwin and
MSYS2 distributions on Windows. So I use my native environment implementation
for convenience.
This is true for the utility commands (<b><i>ar</i></b>, <b><i>objcopy</i></b>,
<b><i>objdump</i></b> and <b><i>size</i></b>) but not for <b><i>gcc</i></b> and
<b><i>ld</i></b>.

<h2>Checkpoint</h2>

I have hacked a quick prototype of <code>uptime</code> and found an extra
dependency to Gnu Arm Embedded Toolchain: some modules included in
<b>libgcc.a</b> have to be included at link time as the chipset I am using has
no support for integer division. At this stage I will reuse the library as it
is, but I know where to look in the map file generated by the linker to find
which modules are included. If I ever need a better control of the link phase,
I can use <code>ar</code> to extract locally those modules from the library.
<p>
<a href="26_uptime.html">Next</a>, I will write <code>uptime</code> with a
better structure.
