<h1>2.2 Another Day, Another Board</h1>

As I switched to a new board, I need to check that the code I wrote so
far is still working as expected. Unfortunately the user LED on the new
board is wired differently than the first one.

<h2>Board Schematics</h2>

<img src="img/22_ledv200.png">
<p>
The new board uses <b>PA4</b> to turn the LED ON when <b>high</b>. Also, by
taking off a jumper, <b>PA4</b> can be used for other purposes.
<p>
The first board uses <b>PB1</b> to turn the LED ON when <b>low</b> as I have
seen previously <a href="14_ledon.html">here</a>.
<p>
I can adapt the code by adding the base address of <b>GPIOA</b> and
shifting pin location accordingly, but this type of variations is so
common that I want to make sure adaptations can be done easily without
errors.

<h2>Board Description</h2>

I want to be able to capture the board variations through simple definitions:
<p>
For the new board:
<pre>
#define LED_IOP A
#define LED_PIN 4
#define LED_ON  1
</pre>

And for the vcc-gnd board:
<pre>
#define LED_IOP B
#define LED_PIN 1
#define LED_ON  0
</pre>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

I make a copy of <b>init.c</b> into <b>board.c</b> and rework the preprocessor
macroes.
<p>
As I have several GPIO peripheral GPIOA .. GPIOF, I switch notation,
instead of writing, say, <code>GPIOA_MODER</code>, I will write either
<code>GPIOA[ MODER]</code> or <code>GPIO( A)[ MODER]</code>. This way I could
refer directly to <code>GPIO( LED_IOP)[ MODER]</code>.
<p>
I use conditional compilation based on <code>LED_ON</code>. If
<code>LED_ON</code> is high, I need an extra step during initialization
compare to <code>LED_ON</code> low. On the other hand, if <code>LED_ON</code>
is undefined, the code would be removed for a board that doesn't have a user
LED.

<pre>
#define SYSTICK             ((volatile long *) 0xE000E010)
#define SYSTICK_CSR         SYSTICK[ 0]
#define SYSTICK_RVR         SYSTICK[ 1]
#define SYSTICK_CVR         SYSTICK[ 2]

#define CAT( a, b) a##b
#define HEXA( a) CAT( 0x, a)
#define RCC                 ((volatile long *) 0x40021000)
#define RCC_AHBENR          RCC[ 5]
#define RCC_AHBENR_IOP( h)  (1 << (17 + HEXA( h) - 0xA))

#define GPIOA               ((volatile long *) 0x48000000)
#define GPIOB               ((volatile long *) 0x48000400)
#define GPIO( x) CAT( GPIO, x)
#define MODER   0
#define ODR     5

/* user LED ON when PA4 is high */
#define LED_IOP A
#define LED_PIN 4
#define LED_ON  1

void SysTick_Handler( void) {
#ifdef LED_ON
    GPIO( LED_IOP)[ ODR] ^= 1 << LED_PIN ;   /* Toggle User LED */
#endif
}

int init( void) {
/* By default SYSCLK == HSI [8MHZ] */

/* SYSTICK */
    SYSTICK_RVR = 1000000 - 1 ;     /* HBA / 8 */
    SYSTICK_CVR = 0 ;
    SYSTICK_CSR = 3 ;               /* HBA / 8, Interrupt ON, Enable */
    /* SysTick_Handler will execute every 1s from now on */

#ifdef LED_ON
/* User LED ON */
    RCC_AHBENR |= RCC_AHBENR_IOP( LED_IOP) ;        /* Enable IOPx periph */
    GPIO( LED_IOP)[ MODER] |= 1 << (LED_PIN * 2) ;  /* LED_IO Output [01],
                                                    ** over default 00 */
    /* OTYPER Push-Pull by default */
    /* Pxn output default LOW at reset */
# if LED_ON
    SysTick_Handler() ;
# endif
#endif
    return 0 ;
}
</pre>

<h2>Build and Test</h2>

I just need to add the <code>SRCS</code> definition in <b>Makefile</b>.

<pre>SRCS = startup.c board.c success.c</pre>

and build.

<pre>
$ make
f030f4.elf
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    224       0       0     224      e0 f030f4.elf
f030f4.hex
f030f4.bin
</pre>

Once I have flashed the board with this new binary, I put back the BOOT0
jumper and press reset. This board user LED is red. &#x1F60E;

<h2>Checkpoint</h2>

I made sure the code I have evolved so far works on the board with the
serial connection.
<p>
<a href="23_hello.html">Next</a>, I will do some serial transmission.
